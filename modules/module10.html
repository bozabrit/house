<header>Module 10</header>
<p>The steps I’ve taken to keep content and presentation separated were putting anything that could be accomplished with CSS in the CSS instead of the HTML. 
Color? #ffffff in the p {} tag. Italics? Oh, no, I changed the entire <strong>font family</strong> to Tahoma or whatever, go big or go home. 
I’ve also used divs and ID tags to separate my coding from each other. With these, it’s much easier to make changes to much larger groups of code than to type each change out individual, such as removing the underlines from <strong></strong>all</strong> links at once instead of each individual link sequentially.
</p>
<p>Up until this point, I hadn’t actually cared about separating content and presentation as much as I should have, because I am terrible at markup and never have any idea what I’m doing. 
In the future, I will hopefully have the knowledge I need to actually create a functioning yet presentable coded document, or a job that does not require this of me.</p>
