<header>Module 10</header>
<p>The steps I’ve taken to keep content and presentation separated were putting anything that could be accomplished with CSS in the CSS instead of the HTML. Color? #ffffff in the p {} tag. Italics? Oh, no, I changed the entire <strong>font family</strong> to Tahoma or whatever, go big or go home.</p>
<p>Up until this point, I hadn’t actually cared about separating content and presentation as much as I should have, because I am terrible at markup and never have any idea what I’m doing. In the future, I will hopefully have the knowledge I need to actually create a functioning yet presentable coded document, or a job that does not require this of me.</p>
